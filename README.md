## Usage

### Compiling and Running the Code

Follow these steps to compile and run the C++ code in this repository using MinGW on Windows:

1. **Compile the Code:**
   
   - Open a terminal in your development environment.

   - Run the build task using the C/C++ extension for Visual Studio Code. Use the following command to compile the active C++ file using the MinGW compiler:

     ```plaintext
     Go to terminal - run build task - C/C++:g++.exe build active file compiler: C:\MinGW\bin\g++.exe
     ```

     This command will compile the active C++ file, creating an output file with a `.exe` extension.

2. **Run the Program:**
   
   - After successfully building the code, open a new terminal window in your development environment.

   - To run the compiled program, use the following command in the terminal, replacing `filename` with the name of the output executable file:

     ```plaintext
     To run the program : Open a new terminal and type "./filename"
     ```

     For example, if your output file is named `my_program.exe`, you would run:

     ```plaintext
     To run the program : Open a new terminal and type "./my_program.exe"
     ```

   - The program will execute, and the output will be displayed in the terminal.

By following these instructions step by step, users can easily compile and run the C++ code in this repository using MinGW on their Windows machines. Make sure not to miss any of these steps for a successful compilation and execution of your program.
