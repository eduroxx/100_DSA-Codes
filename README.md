## Usage

### Compiling and Running the Code

Follow these steps to compile and run the C++ code in this repository using MinGW on Windows:

1. **Open a Terminal:**
   
   - Open a terminal in VS Code.

2. **Navigate to the Code Directory:**
   
   - Use the `cd` command to navigate to the directory where the C++ code file (with the `.cpp` extension) is located. For example:
   
     ```bash
     cd path/to/your/code
     ```

3. **Compile the Code:**
   
   - Use the `g++` compiler from MinGW to compile the C++ code file. You can do this by running the following command:
   
     ```bash
     C:\MinGW\bin\g++.exe -o output_filename.exe your_code.cpp
     ```

     Replace `C:\MinGW\bin\g++.exe` with the actual path to your `g++.exe` compiler executable, and `output_filename.exe` with the desired name of the output executable file. Replace `your_code.cpp` with the name of your C++ source code file.

     For example:
   
     ```bash
     C:\MinGW\bin\g++.exe -o my_program.exe my_program.cpp
     ```

   - This command will create an executable file with the specified name and a `.exe` extension.

4. **Run the Program:**
   
   - To run the compiled program, open a new terminal window (if you haven't already) and navigate to the directory where the executable file is located.

   - Run the program by typing the following command in the terminal:
   
     ```bash
     ./output_filename.exe
     ```

     Replace `output_filename.exe` with the actual name of your compiled executable file.

     For example:
   
     ```bash
     ./my_program.exe
     ```

   - The program should execute, and the output will be displayed in the terminal.

By following these instructions, users can easily compile and run the C++ code in this repository using MinGW on their Windows machines. Be sure to replace placeholders like `output_filename.exe` and `your_code.cpp` with the actual file names and paths relevant to your project.
